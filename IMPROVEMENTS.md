- Implement error handling middleware: Create a reusable error handling middleware function that can intercept any unhandled errors in this application. This middleware should be added early in the middleware stack, before any other routes or middleware that may throw errors. The middleware should catch the error, format it appropriately, and send an appropriate HTTP response with the corresponding status code (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, etc.).

- Centralize error formatting: Define a consistent format for error responses, including the HTTP status code, error message, and any additional relevant information. Centralizing this formatting logic helps maintain consistency across our codebase and ensures that errors are presented to users or clients in a uniform manner. Consider creating a separate utility or helper function to format error responses based on the given error object.

- Write a validation middleware: Implement a validation middleware function using Zod. This middleware should be added to the middleware stack before the route handlers that require input validation. In the middleware, validate the incoming request data against the appropriate validation schema. If the data is invalid, throw a custom validation exception (400, 422 http error).

- Use TypeScript aliases in import statements: Replace the relative path imports with the TypeScript aliases in our code. For example, if we previously had an import statement like:

```ts
import { SomeModule } from '../../../relative/path/to/module';
```

then

```ts
import { SomeModule } from '@alias-name';
```

- Integrate ESLint into our Node.js codebase to enforce code quality and consistency. Configure ESLint rules and plugins, and ensure proper setup for TypeScript support.

- Integrate Git hooks, specifically Husky, to enforce code formatting and linting before committing or pushing code. Set up pre-commit and pre-push hooks to automatically run Prettier and ESLint.

- Migrate mocha to jest: Jest is an all-in-one testing framework with built-in assertion libraries, mocking capabilities, and code coverage reporting. It requires less configuration, has excellent support for asynchronous testing and TypeScript, and includes snapshot testing functionality. Jest's performance optimizations and parallelization result in faster test execution. Additionally, Jest has a vibrant community and ecosystem, ensuring regular updates and access to a wide range of plugins. By migrating to Jest, we can simplify our testing setup, improve performance, and leverage additional features and TypeScript support provided by Jest.

- Migrate code base to DI: By incorporating DI into this codebase, we promote loose coupling and improve testability and maintainability. DI allows we to easily switch dependencies, facilitates mocking and stubbing for testing, and promotes modular and reusable code. Integrating DI with Jest enhances our testing capabilities, as we can now inject mock dependencies into our test cases for more precise and isolated testing.
